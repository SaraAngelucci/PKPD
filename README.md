# Pharmacokinetics of Perampanel in Danish Pediatric Patients with Epilepsy Based on Therapeutic Drug Monitoring

This repository includes the code necessary for reproducing the analysis from the manuscript “Pharmacokinetics of Perampanel in Danish Pediatric Patients with Epilepsy Based on Therapeutic Drug Monitoring”.

The primary analysis script is PKPD_Script.Rmd, which generates the PKPD_Script.html — knitted R Markdown report containing the code, figures, and analysis outputs.  

The full interactive HTML report is available here: (https://saraangelucci.github.io/PKPD/PKPD_Script.html)



As part of the data preparation, the script removes two subjects (subject_id == 28 and subject_id == 38) from the master data file before analysis.
